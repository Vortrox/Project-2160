## Project description
Addressing climate change is a global imperative, driving nations to adopt sustainable practices. One avenue gaining traction is the promotion of Electric Vehicles (EVs), which align with renewable energy goals and emission reduction targets. However, Australia's pace in adopting EVs contrasts with global trends, highlighting the need for analysis and intervention.

Despite a growing range of EV models and global incentives, Australia's EV adoption remains sluggish. To confront this challenge, a comprehensive analysis of car registration and sales data is essential. This data-driven approach aims to uncover the nuanced factors hindering widespread EV adoption in the country, ranging from consumer perceptions and economic considerations to infrastructure limitations and policy gaps.

Our analysis aims to find trends in the data that will lead to suggestions for how the industry and legislation can improve the uptake of EVs.By leveraging insights from data analysis, Australia can reshape its approach to EV adoption, driving sustainable mobility and contributing to a greener future.
